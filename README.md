# Problem Statement ‼️
In the diamond industry, accurate pricing is a critical challenge due to the variability of diamond features such as carat, cut, colour, clarity, and dimensions. 
The pricing process often involves manual evaluation, which can be subjective and inconsistent. 
This creates the need for a robust and data-driven solution to estimate diamond prices reliably and transparently.
