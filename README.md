# Data Source :- 
Kaggle (Diamond Price Dataset with 50,000 records).

# Problem Statement ‚ÄºÔ∏è
In the diamond industry, accurate pricing is a critical challenge due to the variability of diamond features such as carat, cut, colour, clarity, and dimensions. 
The pricing process often involves manual evaluation, which can be subjective and inconsistent. 
This creates the need for a robust and data-driven solution to estimate diamond prices reliably and transparently.

# Challenges 
1) **Outliers:** Managing outliers to ensure they do not overly bias the model while retaining their valid variability. 
2) **Categorical Features:** Encoding qualitative attributes like cut, color, and clarity effectively for both tree-based and scaling-based models. 
3) **Model Tuning:** Balancing computation time during hyperparameter tuning for a large dataset. 

# Practical Applications üíÅ

1) **E-Commerce Platforms :-** Automating pricing recommendations for diamonds listed on online marketplaces. 

2) **Inventory Management :-** Helping jewelers value their inventory based on consistent pricing. 

3) **Fraud Detection :-** Identifying discrepancies in diamond pricing for authentication and fraud prevention. 

4) **Customer Decision Support :-** Assisting customers in understanding and justifying diamond prices during purchases.
